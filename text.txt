Hi everyone this is an example!

Color Themes for Terminal in VS CODE: https://glitchbone.github.io/vscode-base16-term/#/porple

These are my notes 

Recursively Add Video 
    When you add a heirechy or folders withing folders and also files. 
    your git status will only show you the directory folder where all the changes were made. 
    to show all the files changed within all these folders is by using 

        git add . ----------> This will add all the files changed Recusively.

Backing out changes 
    When you modify a file you can add and stage those changes by using 
        
        git add { name of the file }
    
    Once this is done we are staging the changes in the file. if by any chance the 
    user doesnt want those changes anymore and they would like to disregard those changes we can use 

        git reset HEAD < File Name >   ------------> This unstages the changes made in that particular file.

    After the user would have to use 

        git checkout -- < File Name >   ------------> This is used to discard any changes from the file. 

    Next time you open the file you will see that the changes are not there anymore.


Renaming and Moving files Video
    
    The following git command will automatically let git know the name of the file was renamed.

        git mv < File Name > < File New Name >  -------------> this is used to rename a file in git this is also to move the file. 
    

        git mv < File New Name > < Orginal FIle Name >
